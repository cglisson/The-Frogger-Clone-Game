## How to Play...

Here is how to play:
* On the startup page, choose your character from the drop-down menu.
* Your player will move in accordance of the arrow keys on your keyboard.
* Try to avoid the evil bugs; otherwise, you will die.
* A new level will generate when you safely make it to the selector.
* The game ends in either:
    * A win - when you successfully make it through three levels.
    * A loss - when you collide with an evil bug.

the game better.
